Palette Activity and Canvas Activity

This app contains a Spinner that will use a custom adapter to present to the user 
a set of color options. 
When a user selects a color from the Adapter View, the second activity should be
launched and this new acitvity's layout backround will be set to the selected color
and a TextView will appear with the name of the color.
